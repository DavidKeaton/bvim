[bvim : Binary VIsual editor iMproved]
======================================
https://github.com/DavidKeaton/bvim

An improved hex editor rewritten from the original `bvi' from
Gerhard Buergmann.

How to compile
==============
	./configure
	make && make install


MAC OS X
========
Looks like the curses implementation in Darwin is really limited.
You should install and use ncurses instead. You can download it from
ftp.gnu.org; install it and then use
	./configure --with-ncurses=/usr/local/ncurses-5.2
